RDMA API + virtio stub (M0/M1) change log

Summary
- Added an RDMA device API endpoint and schema and wired it into /vm/config.
- Added VMM resource storage and pre-boot VmmAction handling for RDMA devices.
- Implemented a minimal virtio-rdma stub device (1 queue, no features) and attached it in the VMM builder.
- Updated snapshot persistence to skip RDMA devices for now.
- Extended metrics definitions for RDMA PUT requests and updated test schema list.
